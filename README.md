# Mapping Global Brain Reconfigurations Following Local Targeted Manipulations

This repository contains the code, data, and supplementary materials associated with the publication:

**Mapping global brain reconfigurations following local targeted manipulations**  
Published in *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), 2025*

## 📄 Paper Overview

This study investigates how **localized brain interventions**, such as thalamic lesions and chemogenetic silencing of cortical hubs, influence **global brain functional connectivity (FC)**. Using longitudinal **fMRI datasets** collected from mice and **personalized computational simulations**, the study reveals:

- Local interventions trigger widespread functional reconfigurations across the brain.
- Changes in local excitability and firing rates mediate these global effects.
- The resulting patterns depend on the intervention site, generating region-specific functional signatures.
- These insights explain paradoxical hypo- and hyperconnectivity findings in the literature, with implications for diagnosing and treating brain disorders.
